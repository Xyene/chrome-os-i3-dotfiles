# cros-dotfiles
My dotfiles for running an i3-based environment within Chrome OS (via Crostini).

It works by setting up a Xephyr session without Sommelier, and directing i3 to it. [xclipsync](https://github.com/apenwarr/xclipsync) is used to keep the Chrome OS and Xephyr clipboards synced.

Included are configuration files and scripts for:

* i3-gaps
* rofi
* uxterm
* polybar
* vim
